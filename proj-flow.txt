Steps

1. create a github repo and clone it on your local
2. Create mycode.py and add code to it. (it will save a csv file to a new "data" folder)
3. Do a git add-commit-push before initializing dvc.


4. pip install dvc
5. Now dvc init (creates .dvcignore, .dvc)

6. Now create a folder names "s3"
7. Add remote orgin to DVC ("dvc remote add -d myremote s3") // "s3" is the folder names

6. Telling dvc to perform versioning of all the files inside folder data "dvc add data/" 
7. git tells us to stop traching data folder 
    git rm -r --cached 'data'
    git commit -m "stop tracking data"
8. Now if we run dvc add data/ it will run and creates (data.dvc)
    Also dvc asks to run "git add .gitignore data.dvc" because dvc added few changes to it (md5 and id changes)

9. Now do "dvc commit" and "dvc push" so that it will move the csv file to s3 folder
10. Do a git add-commit-push to mark this stage as first version of data

11. Now make changes to mycode.py to append a new row in data, check changes via "dvc status"
It will show:
data.dvc:                                                                                                                                  
        changed outs:
                modified:           data

12. Now do "dvc commit"
It will ask: outputs ['data'] of stage: 'data.dvc' changed. Are you sure you want to commit it? [y/n] y 

13. Do "dvc push"
It will create two new files is "s3" folder with new md5 id and the file with update csv data

//git won't be tracking "s3" folder for new changes, it will track data.dvc where you find new md5 id


14. now repeat the steps 11-13 for the v3 data


15. Now rolling back the v1 from v3

do git log --oneline

you will find privious commits along with its sha id. copy the sha id of of first version (v1)

16. git checkout <hash_id>  // will revert the code changes in mycode.py (both GF1 and GF2 will be commented)

17. dvs status  // it will say modified
18. dvc pull
19. dvc status // says Data and pipelines are up to date.

20. If we want to revert again to v3 changes. do git checkout main
21. dvc status says modified
22. dvc pull
